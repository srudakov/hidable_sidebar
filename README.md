# hidable_sidebar
Dokuwiki template with button to toggle sidebar.

Its like original “default” template, but with button to toggle sidebar visibility. Button has russian text.

Why not simple_sidebar(https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:simple_sidebar)?
Because simple_sidebar can't let you hide sidebar and keep it hidden after page reload or after openning new wiki page.

Why template and not plugin?
Because plugins are applied after loading template and if you want keep sidebar hidden after reload, you'll see that it will be shown for a moment and then disappear. Not cool.
